# Hikki

A Notion-like, local-first note-taking app for macOS.

- **Your files, yours** — documents live as plain JSON + assets in `~/Hikki` (relocatable, iCloud-friendly). A derived SQLite FTS5 index powers instant search and is always rebuildable.
- **Editor** — BlockNote block editor with slash commands, images and file attachments stored inside your vault; AI Writing Tools (Phase 3) and voice input (Phase 7) are next.
- **Stack** — Tauri 2 (Rust), React 19, shadcn/ui, Jotai, Vite.
